# Bunny Runner

Bunny Runner is my final project for the the 2025 CS50x course, consisting of an endless runner game developed with Love2D and Lua, inspired by Google's [Dinosaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game). All the assets used were provided by [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/).

## How to play

Run `love .` or download the `bunny-runner.zip` file, extract it in a folder and open the `.exe` file. And have fun, of course!
